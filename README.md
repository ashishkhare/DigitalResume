# Digital Resume

This is my Digital Resume built for learning Azure deployment. It's a static website hosted using Azure portal.
Please note I am using Azure Free Subscription to deploy the same.

## Frontend resources

The front-end is a static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- I leave designing to the experts and hence, I used this [template](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/) to create my site.
- This is how you can [deploy static site to blob storage.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-host)
